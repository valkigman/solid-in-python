## Uncle Bob's SOLID Principles of OOP

SOLID stands for:

S - Single-responsibility Principle.<br/>
O - Open-closed Principle.<br/>
L - Liskov Substitution Principle.<br/>
I - Interface Segregation Principle.<br/>
D - Dependency Inversion Principle.<br/>

### Single-responsibility Principle (SRP):

States that a class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### Open-closed Principle (OCP):

States that objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle states:

States that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.Simply put, if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.

### Interface segregation principle:

States that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

### Dependency inversion principle:

States that entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
